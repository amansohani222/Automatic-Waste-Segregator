# Automatic-Waste-Segregator
An arduino based smart device which separates dry and wet waste.
It uses infrared sensor to detect whether or not waste is present on flip board. If waste is present arduino board will trigger moisture sensor and if moisture level is greater than (room moisture level + some fixed value) then arduino will rotate the servo motor left or right based on waste type.
